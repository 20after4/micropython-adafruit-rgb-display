ESP32-WROVER LCD Display Driver for MicroPython
===============================================
This is a fork of the Adafruit Display drivers for MicroPython. Only a couple
of minor changes were made to adapt the Adafruit driver to work with the LCD
on the Espressif ESP32-WROVER kit (Version 3)

Example code is included in example.py.

Tested with MicroPython esp32 v1.9.1-214-g43d7a9d2.bin. Get the latest firmware
from http://micropython.org/download#esp32
